Please refer to the below snapshots: This is how the Transactions section currently looks: There are five sections within Transactions: Recognised Transactions:\u00a0These are the transactions which Zluri has recognised from the financial integrations and has mapped to an application and are SaaS related. For mapping the transaction, we use the Transaction Description. If the Transaction Description matches the application name, Zluri maps the transaction to that application. Unrecognised Transactions:\u00a0These are the transactions unrelated to SaaS, or Zluri has not been able to recognise from the financial integrations and has not mapped to any application. Archived Transactions:\u00a0These are the transactions which are non-SaaS related. Also, any other transaction that customers don\u2019t want to be included can be archived. Customers can move these types of transactions to Archive so that their data is not visible on the dashboard. Payment Methods:\u00a0Customers can add payment methods like Credit cards, Bank Accounts and other Payment Options on this page.

Please take a look at the links below: Generic steps to setup SAML OneLogin SAML Okta SAML JumpCloud SAML Google SAML App store settings configuration Zluri's employee dashboard is a single place for your employees to discover and request licenses for all SaaS applications used in your organization and request applications from Zluri's market's largest library of applications. Admin can enable the Employee App store for employees by toggling the highlighted toggle bar field at the top right corner. You can configure- it from the \"Employee App Store\" option on the Settings page. \u25cf \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Which applications within your organization will be visible to your employees. \u25cf \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0What information about these applications will your employees be able to view. \u25cf \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Choosing the authorization level to define applications that are part of your organization. On selecting \"Show Unmanaged Apps,\" an employee can view all the unmanaged applications in the organization. Depending on your organization's internal security compliance and application provisioning process, you can configure the settings here accordingly. Examples \u25cf \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0If your organization needs employees to see only the applications used within their department, which they can then request licenses for, you can choose \"Employee Department Apps.\" \u25cf \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0If you only need your employees to see applications that your IT admins have categorized as \"managed\" apps within Zluri, you can turn off the options to show unmanaged, restricted, and uncategorized apps \u25cf \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0If you do not need your employees to see security and compliance information about a particular application within the app store, you can turn off the options to show security information and compliance. While employees can still search for, find information about, and raise requests for ~225k applications within Zluri's library, configuring these settings upfront will ensure employees see only the information they need to see about the IN USE applications within your organization. A unique feature of access management is the branding of the organization. Both logo and the favicon can be uploaded. Configuring automation rules for approval workflows Automation rules help your employees' license and application requests go through the appropriate approval processes followed within your organization. Automation Rule Sections To set up an Automation Rule, click on App Requisition - -> Automation Rules--> New Rule. An automation rule consists of five sections: Request Type Suppose your organization has different approval processes for applications already in use (License of an Existing Application is Requested) and not used (New Application is Requested) by your organization. In that case, you can use this option to differentiate the two. Conditions You can customize your approval workflows by creating multiple automation rules with different conditions. Sample scenarios - Users who have a \"Manager\" designation and users who have an \"Associate\" designation. Users with an \"Employee\" account type and users with a \"Service\" or \"External\" account type. Members of the \"Sales\" or \"Marketing\" department and members of the \"Engineering\" department. You can differentiate the approval processes using different conditions in different automation rules for these above scenarios and much more. Actions For a specific request that fits the request type and conditions specified above, you can set up the rule to either initiate an approval process that'll go through a list of approvers you've configured or automatically reject the request. Approvers For requests not auto-rejected, you can select one or more approvers responsible for reviewing the request and approving or rejecting it accordingly. You can assign specific roles as approvers - the default dropdown when you \"add people\" will contain a list of roles configured within Zluri, such as IT admin, app owner, department head, and reporting manager. This is helpful in scenarios when the user's reporting manager or department head needs to approve each request before it moves onto a different approver. Alternatively, specific individuals can also be searched for and added as approvers. Configuring this section is mandatory for a rule to be saved. Provisioning and de-provisioning actions Once a request is approved, the license needs to be provisioned to the user, which can be configured in the \"On approval\" section. And once the requested license duration is completed, the license de-provisioning process can be set up in the \"Offboarding action\" section. In both scenarios, the setup is very similar. The provisioning and de-provisioning actions can be configured as a manual task - select a task owner who'll be notified to procure a license once the request is approved (in case of provisioning) or remove license access once the duration has ended (in case of de-provisioning), and specify within how many days the task has to be completed. The \"on approval\" section configuration is mandatory to save a rule. \"Offboarding action\" is optional. After entering all the above-required details, the automation rule can be saved that will look like this: Automation rules priority When multiple rules are set up, they can be arranged in decreasing order of priority. For example, if two rules have similar conditions and different approvers are involved or other provisioning/de-provisioning actions are configured, the rule with the higher priority takes precedence. Automation rule setup best practices \u25cf\u00a0Identifying your organization's current approval process broadly can help set up a few basic rules that can serve most of your employees' application requests while giving the admins enough context to customize the rules even further. \u25cf\u00a0Ensure all roles, either Zluri administrator roles or roles that differ from one app to another (app owner) or one employee to another (reporting manager or department head), are comprehensively configured(under Users and Department sections) so that the approval process does not run into any obstacles. Approval Process Once an employee submits a request, approvers will be notified in a sequential order to approve or reject the request. If an approver is unavailable, admins can add new approvers to this request to take this action in place of them, or the admins can approve or reject the request on behalf of the approver. One can click on the three dots for an application to view the submitted request. On clicking the View Request, an employee/approver will be able to view all the details necessary for him to approve or reject the request and also some other information (like View Change log, The app is used in the org or not, Other approvers for this request, offboarding actions, request due days, comments by others) which is highlighted in the below screenshot: In this approval process, the power to override the approval or rejection decision depends on the authority level. The higher authority can override the decision taken by the lower admins or the managers. The admins can also add comments explaining why the particular request was rejected.
